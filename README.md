# Reinforcement-Learning-SF2-SOC

Name- Adit Srivastava(22b1269)

This is a brief report of what I have learnt in  the project.

Week0:
Introduction to the mentor and my teammates as we started our journey in RL by watching lecture 1 and 2 of prof.David Silver's course in RL which immediately sparked an interest and taught us the basics of RL. After this we were made to solve a short theory task on the contents of the 2 lectures.

Week 1:
The theory task for this week was to learn about varius probability distributions and how to simulate them on python with the numpy library.
We also learnt about the most basic RL algorithm, the epsilon greedy algorithm and were made to implement this in a problem statement(The multi-armed bandit).
The tasks for this week were solving a theory task on probability distributions and the problem statement mentioned above.
