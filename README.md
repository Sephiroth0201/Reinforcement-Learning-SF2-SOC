# Reinforcement-Learning-SF2-SOC

Name- Adit Srivastava(22b1269)

This is a brief report of what I have learnt in  the project.

Week0:
Introduction to the mentor and my teammates as we started our journey in RL by watching lecture 1 and 2 of prof.David Silver's course in RL which immediately sparked an interest and taught us the basics of RL. After this we were made to solve a short theory task on the contents of the 2 lectures.
There an optional problem statement where we were made to simulate a very simple MDP named  'carMDP'.

Week 1:
The theory task for this week was to learn about varius probability distributions and how to simulate them on python with the numpy library.
We also learnt about the most basic RL algorithm, the epsilon greedy algorithm and were made to implement this in a problem statement(The multi-armed bandit).
The tasks for this week were solving a theory task on probability distributions and the problem statement mentioned above.

Week 2,3:
These two weeks invloved our first actual project in RL implementing everything we learnt until then. We familiarised ourselves with openAIgym and watched lectures 3,4,5,6 of david silver's lecture series to know all the different methids we can use to solve a game.There were 4 problems out of which we had to solve atleast 1, the games were Taxi,CartPole,MountainCar and LunarLander. We had to submit an ipynb file with the code and play with different parameters to see which setting is most optimised for learning.

Week 4,5,6:
After learning about function approximation in lecture 6 of daivd silver's lecture series we proceed to learn about neural networks and how gradient descent works using 3b1b's youtube playlist on neural networks.We also continued watching Lec 7,8,9,10 of the lecture series to learn policy gradients and a number of other concepts which we would need in order to solve our final problem(street fighter 2).
